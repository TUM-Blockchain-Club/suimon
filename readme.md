## Introduction

Suimon is a location-based collectible TCG that allows users to explore their surroundings and collect unique creatures called Suimon. Suimon are NFTs with different rarities and types, and users can battle each other for other Suimon using a random weighted chance of victory based on Suimon power, type advantage, and Sui's random function.

## Problem Statement

Traditional TCGs are limited by their physical nature, and digital TCGs often lack the excitement of exploration and discovery. Suimon solves this problem by leveraging the Sui blockchain and location-based technology to create a unique and immersive gaming experience.

## Our Solution

Suimon combines the best of both worlds by bringing the excitement of exploration and discovery to the digital realm. Our solution uses the Sui blockchain to create a secure, transparent, and decentralized gaming experience.
